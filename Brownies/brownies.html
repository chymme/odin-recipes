          <ul>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa</li>
            <li>1 3/4 cups granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>8 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil</li>

          <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375Â°F. Lightly grease a 9" x 13" pan.</li>
            <li>Put all of the ingredients into a large bowl in the order in which they're written. Stir, then beat the mixture until it's smooth.</li>    
            <li>Spoon the batter into the prepared pan.</li>
            <li>Bake the brownies for about 25 minutes, or until they're just barely beginning to pull away from the sides of the pan. A toothpick inserted into the center will come out clean or 
                with a few moist crumbs clinging to it; you shouldn't see any wet batter.</li>

            <li>Remove the brownies from the oven; let them cool completely before cutting. Store any leftovers, well-wrapped, at room temperature for 5 to 6 days. Freeze for longer storage.</li>
