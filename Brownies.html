        <div class="ingredients">
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa</li>
                <li>1 3/4 cups granulated sugar</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon baking powder</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon espresso powder, optional; for enhanced chocolate flavor</li>
                <li>3 large eggs</li>
                <li>8 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
                <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="instructions">
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 375Â°F. Lightly grease a 9" x 13" pan.</li>

                <li>Put all of the ingredients into a large bowl in the order in which they're written. Stir, then beat the mixture until it's smooth.</li>
                
                <li>Spoon the batter into the prepared pan.</li>

                <li>Bake the brownies for about 25 minutes, or until they're just barely beginning to pull away from the sides of the pan. A toothpick inserted into the center will come out clean or 
                    with a few moist crumbs clinging to it; you shouldn't see any wet batter.</li>

                <li>Remove the brownies from the oven; let them cool completely before cutting. Store any leftovers, well-wrapped, at room temperature for 5 to 6 days. Freeze for longer storage.</li>
            </ol>
