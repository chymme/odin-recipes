         <div class="ingredients">

            <div class="crust">
                <ul>
                    <li>1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs, 9 to 10 whole graham crackers, crushed</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup confectioners' sugar</li>
                    <li>5 1/3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
                    <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="filling">
                <ul>
                    <li>two 8-ounce packages cream cheese, at room temperature</li>
                    <li>2/3 cup granulated sugar</li>
                    <li>2 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="Instructions">
                <ol>
                    <li>Select a pie pan whose inside top dimension is at least 9", and whose height is at least 1 1/4".
                         Preheat the oven to 350°F.</li>

                    <li>To make the crust: Stir together all of the crust ingredients, mixing until thoroughly combined.</li>

                    <li>Press the crumbs into the bottom and up the sides of the pie pan, making a thicker layer on the bottom than on the sides.</li>

                    <li>To make the filling: Mix together the room-temperature cream cheese and sugar until smooth. Mix in the eggs and vanilla, again mixing until smooth.
                         To avoid beating too much air into the batter, use a mixer set at low-medium speed. To avoid lumps, make sure the cream cheese is softened, 
                         and/or at room temperature.</li>

                    <li>Set the pie pan onto a baking sheet, if desired; this makes it easier to transport in and out of the oven, and also protects the bottom of the crust 
                        from any potential scorching. Pour the filling into the crust.</li>

                    <li>To bake the cheesecake: Place the cheesecake in the oven. Bake it for 20 minutes, then add a crust shield; or shield the crust with strips of aluminum foil.
                         Bake for an additional 10 minutes (for a total of about 30 minutes). A digital thermometer inserted into the filling 1" from the edge should read between 
                         165°F and 170°F; the filling won't look entirely set in the center.</li>

                    <li>Remove the cheesecake from the oven and set it on a rack to cool. Once the cake is cool, refrigerate it, covered, until you're ready to serve it.</li>
                </ol>
